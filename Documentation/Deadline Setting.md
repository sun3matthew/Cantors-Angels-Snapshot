# Deadline Setting
First of all, the deadline for SPR(Store page release) would have been the start of next quarter.
I don't think I should lie and say that it was just bc I wasn't working hard enough. It was a mixture of many things, one of which was putting alot of work into a relationship. Glad I did, glad I don't. Either way you can track my progress on the game on the github. And there has been a major gap where there shouldn't have been. I think thats why I had originally set the deadline for the start of that quarter.
Ok, now that I'm thinking abt it, I 100% have a problem with, overestimating how much I can do. I think in the past I made deadlines because I sacrificed the quality. I don't want to do that anymore. So I need to set realistic deadlines, realisitic deadlines for a new standard of work. 
All of this tells me that I need to push things back.
I do think there needs to be a medium tho. Like I can't just chase a perfect that won't exist.
Though I feel like those games exist. Like ITB, HK, SDV
Other games are not perfect but they're like pretty good, and gets cleaned up very well after release.
The only thing that I really want to fine tune on is Art.
I should aim for perfect for now. I've never done it before so I don't think I know how to set good deadlines or expectations.
We'll see.
