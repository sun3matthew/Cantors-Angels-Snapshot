All information is exposed, meaning you can run a algorithm to try to find the best possible moves if you wanted to.

For this to be possible, the enemy movements follow a strict algorithm and there is no randomness. 
This means before you end your turn, you know where the enemies will move and attack. Their action set happens right after you end turn.
This eliminates the concept of a true turn, or a linear gameplay. You can always undo as many moves as you want.
The game will keep track of all branches that have been attempted.

Any randomness such as spawn points, natural event are exposed, you can see when it happens,
	Basically any randomness needs to be exposed, fully deterministic.

Heresy
Non-determanistic randomness in the form of enemies possibly teleporting to a random position before moving, then recalculating and moving.
Gain Heresy be losing Churches.


There will be different worlds, with different seeds. Like Into the Breach islands.
Different enemies, natural wonders, natural disasters.

Angels can jump, not bound by mech
when a mech has no angel, it just idles there. Can only regen at factory.
When a mech dies with a angel, it explodes.
