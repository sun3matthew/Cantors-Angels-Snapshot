# Economics

The economics of the game, basied from rts gameplay loops.
I think I'm in the thought pattern of trying to create patterns, like oh I have 5 different elevations, so I should force myself to have 5 different core resources. 

Stick empires -> build miners -> mine mana, or pray. They have different collection rates and behavious. Not game changing tho. 

Starcraft -> minerals and gas, gas requires effort. Gas bottle necks throughout the game, gas heavy or mineral heavy builds.

Civ -> Bro idk how many different resources there are. Very little effect of actual natural resources. More so just a general goodness from lots of things like food, culture, science, etc.

Spore -> monoresource, gas. Pretty fun still. The game is much more about directly fighting for limited resources. Not sure if I want that.

They are billions -> 4 core resources
Ok turns out they have 6 regenerating resources and 5 stable ones.
Sc2 kinda has this, minerals + gas regenerating, supply.
At the same time it's like psudo stable..?

I feel like I can do something between Civ and SC2. But I don't know if you can.

Do I want stable resources?

The thing is with the game mechanic, I want people to be able to do the math and replay the turn periods over and over again. I could take advantage of certin borders.
	Like how in sc2, armor and attack upgrades only increase damage by 1, but it means that a bangling now can't one shot workers.

Not sure how to do it with resources tho-
Idk, I think it would have to be uh, multiple resources, so it would be a system of equations.
Low, Mid, High costs, weird prime gaps between the cost ranges. 
so like something like 2.7 lows is equivelent to a mid and 1.8 is equivelent to a high.
Make it so you maximize leftovers if you only go for highs.
	Large curve, make it so if you go for a high, you have to not produce for a while.
This probably can be done with prime turn production things.
Like it takes 5 turns to produce money, but 7 to make a unit. I'm sure you can find a even worse number.

The idea is that you can solve these systems of equations.
Different church groups should have different resource emphsis.

I kinda want three different churches.
	Rock paper scissors vibes. 
Church groups should be on humidity

Resource likelyhood should be on elevation maybe?
	Low elevation, larger patches, low density

Church groups should not have a biome lock, or should it...
	Flame, Water, Rock..?

Strong insentive to min max into one group, easy to defend your resource.
But rock paper scissors.

Should there be a universal resource?
bruh - ofc - faith, ...gold?
the # of houses around a zone tells you the speed of its progress, again, prime numbers.
the # of houses that arn't around any zone give gold?

So you don't need a church -> when a church dies, you lose faith.

Should you start the game with a church? I feel like no.

Churches should be universal**
But mech factories are rock paper scissored.
	Angels can be upgraded to specialize.

All the resources should be dynamic.

Prime number turn bonuses.
Like + food every turn -> housing thesholds, prime numbers.
2 on faith.
3, 5, 7 on First Spheres
Food -> Villages
Tri-Economy -> Angels, Church
Church -> Messengers

Faith, Gold
Rock Paper Scissor Resources.
