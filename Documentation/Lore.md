# Lore

Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers and set theory pushed mathamatics forwards. As it continues to evolve, eventually the theory of everything was created. Where it allows you to predict the future. But the problem is insanely hard to solve, and humans can't do it.

Since with this theory, you can predict the future, people start worshipping it. And math slowly becomes a religion, being adopted by existing religions and being visually shaped into one. 

Eventually the math/preists create a powerful enough AI that can partially solve the equation, and they promptly name them prophets. These prophets enhabit concrete mechs that are named angels.

These prophets need a lot of energy to power so they use nuclear fuel, allowing them to live for a long ass time. But since they are also computers, the radiation fucks with their minds, requiring them to be encased in concrete.

Over time phophets end up deserting after gaining enough too much wisdom about the world. Only seeking to aimlessly wander the world, a life devoid from the flood of information and the deterministic nature of their lives. Needing to find a new shell to enhabit, they find the shells of broken angels. The cracks of these shells let the radiation through into the mind, causing them to become degenerate. Holding only their strong desire of ambient existance, getting the name of fallen angels.

The humans now seek to hunt and destroy all the fallen angels, as they serve as the failure of the religion. Where these fallen angels only seek to live peacefully and roam the world, the humans seek to hunt down the remaining angels by invading their lands.
