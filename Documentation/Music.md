# Music

Deliverables: 6-9+ different pieces, 3 - 4 mins each.

6-9+ pieces, each with a specific melody/vibe.  
To expand on this, what’s important to me is to have at least piece that can instantly remind the player of the game, Can You Hear The Music - Oppenheimer, City of Tears - Hollow Knight, Sweden - Minecraft, Undertale - Undertale, The First Layer - Made in Abyss, Sogno di Volare ("The Dream of Flight") - Civilization VI, Halo - Halo

These are also just good soundtracks that I like a lot, and what I'd hope to want. Example for thematic consistency, four seasons, similar vibes.

Vibe: Scifi Religious Dystopian

At the end of the day, a fire soundtrack is a fire soundtrack, so the vibe of the game does not have to match the music perfectly. I’d rather have fire music in a style you’re good at / are more passionate about. That being said, here are a few spitballs  
Church Choir, Religious game.

Expectations

At the end of the day, I okay the music, which means to save time. I want lots of communication and progress pieces (early melody, instruments you’re using etc.), lmk what music you’d want to take inspiration from and what you’re thinking and looking at.  
The trailer will be released at the end of summer, so by then I’d want at least one of the pieces. I’ll be updating you on the status of the game, sending you playtests so you know the vibe.

Money

If you have an app you need or a sound pack you want, lmk, I’ll see what I can do.  
I’m not sure how long it’ll take to make the sound track, but I’m willing to pay $128 per song.
