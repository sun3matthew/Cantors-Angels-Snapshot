# Problems

The decision tree could be boring
Therefor there needs to be many binary/trinary/etc decisions what can cause a branch. Attacks on two sides, specilizing in a group of angels

Boring battles, larger number of Angels? With usg, the number of Angels can increase. More options for stratagy.

State delta changes that need updates, such as new ability updates will vastly change the outcomes.
There needs to be version number associated with the turn set. 
This means the game needs to have a version system checker. There should also be combatability checker, you can try the equivelent of a git rebase.
