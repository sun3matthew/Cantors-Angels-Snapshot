# Return to Sender

Figuring out wtf I was doing before/ reunderstand the codebase. Note down anything that from a first reaction is ass with the gameplay/visuals. Since I ignored it last time, essentially its a fresh pair of eyes and thats good to have. Its good to have in general-
Also Revamp a Roadmap, and a TODO list with smaller less roadmappy things (big fixes, quality of life).

## TODO
Move bug, you can't move to some tiles for some reason sometimes.
Overlapping Tests and arrows

## Questions
What makes the game unique, why this game over the other ones.

## Road Map

Maybe add economy where time between deployments determine cost of it (spice wise).
Have a mech movement cost for faith. Churches come with a angel that gives powers and free moves.

Solo church, tri church, hex church (make it so that the damage of the ring of churches will always destroy the central).
Tri should give three teir 2 angels and hex should give 7 teir 3

We also need to add ranged Hadics.

Balance it so there is more shit to do early game/throughout the game.
Cheaper Units, more small attack squads.

Scout Mech, can't be so cheap that you use it just for planet fall.
Or a bunker -> auto attacks the closest hadic, walls too?

# Player Promises
You can move backwards in time in major and minor steps to fix and try new paths.
There must be many different *unique* approaches and stratagies.
Every seed grants a new playthrough- replayability. 
The is no information is purposly hidden from the player.

Therefor-
It must be very easy to explore and make moves. Action auto queueing, through UI(customizalbe), Hotkeys.
There must be many different stratagies. Battle stratagies, economic stratagies, key decisions, playstyle. Each of these should have a place where one is not always used. Have stratagies on a scalar too, where it can become much more subjective.
Different seeds should have wildly different resource distributions, rich, poor, and density, also number of islands, elevation distrabutions. Alien types/ distrabutions, should be a sliding scale of alien "hive behavior", such as swarming.. not sure what else, utility? Brute? Essentially zerg, terran, protoss..?  Indivudial alien behaviour must not change* There does not need to be infinite replayability. No game has that. Except minecraft.* 
High information avalability and density, I kinda wanted it to be a game to look like a nerd. If you want you can toggle on all the UI elements and hotkey your way through victory.

## Stratagies
Idk- I feel like it comes by itself. Just implement what you can, and try to discover your own new play styles, then come back to this and maybe fine tune more/balance.

## Branchability
It is not in human nature to use the possibility of branches. When you solve a math problem, you don't just stop at the first "branch" such as to expand or factor. You keep going until it blows up or looks like it won't work out. Branching still exists, but not in the same way. You can encourage branching all you want but people will never use it that much, which is fine imo. It's good to have for minor branching but it dosn't need to be part of the core gameplay. Not part of player promises

## Replayability
More resources? Probably not. That adds complexity just to add complexity
Resource Distribution =
	Faith heavy, Spice heavy
Alien Distributions
	Ranged? 
	
Unit Types
	Faith heavy Psykers
	Spice heavy Marines
	Neutral Mercenaries
Alien Types
	Brutes
	Swarms
	Neutral
Psykers -> Swarms
Psykers <- Brutes
Psykers = Neutral

Marines -> Brutes
Marines <- Swarm
Marines = Neutral

Neutral = $\forall$

Can we have time sensative hadics, ie, blows up in x turns, or duplicates in x turns, or produces a hadic producer in x turns.

I don't wan't hard coded buffs and weaknesses, like in league, theres no "unit type" like in sc2. Maybe have some stuff like armor or special abilities to remove effects, but just happens to be more affective. Like only have large area damage but weak attacks.

Either way these are all subjective and kinda on a scalar. 

League Case Study, none of these are hard coded into the game, just stat counters
	Fighters
	Mages
	.
	Juggernauts
	Tanks
	Assanians
	Marksmen
	.
	Supports


Ambient structures that boost tile stats?
