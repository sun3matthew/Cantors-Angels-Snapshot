# Roadmap

PSPR
Get the visuals all in...? We'll see. Tbh I don't know how long it'll take. I only have two weeks which isn't enough anyways. And I don't know how long it'll take total.
	Gets get the general color pallet decided better.
	UI?
	I want churches, more mechs and more hadics.
Honestly, maybe wait for SPR... I don't want to show a very unfinished project.
	Its like for FLS, I don't want to show a sketch or a shitty artwork that dosn't capture the feeling I'm going for. I'd want to show a artwork that caputres that feeling but might not be perfect or finished yet.
	Honesty it's pretty simmilar imo. Early luck, was shit, go again.
		LMAO if it is then aft erthis works out, I call it a day and move on from this phase of my life.

SPR at end of school year.
Basically get it to a finished art state.

Marketing + Build up Community for however long it takes.
	Kickstarter?
I feel like the game has some viral moments.

FR at not soon.
